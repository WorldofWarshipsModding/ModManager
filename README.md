# World of Warships Mod Manager

The World of Warships Mod Manager is a simple app to manage your mods for World of Warships.

If you wish to become a mod maintainer and publish a mod so that it can be downloaded with the Mod Manager, head over to the [WoWS Mod Archive](https://github.com/WorldofWarshipsModding/wows_modarchive).

## Building on W10
- clone the repository
- open `WoWS Mod Manager.sln` with Visual Studio, let it install UWP support if it asks to
- press `F5` (or your explicitly configured hotkey) to build
- if W10's developer mode is off, the build will fail, and Visual Studio will open the settings window where you can enable it. Do that and build again
